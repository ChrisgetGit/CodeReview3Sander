/* (5) Create a class Station containing following parameters:

        stationID (Integer)

        location (String)

        bikes: Bikes data structure is storing all Bikes that are currently in this station Decide yourself what data structure you want to use

        (5) Create 3 Station objects in your main() and put them in a HashMap - stations



        (10) Create a method of the Station class:

        addBike(... some parameter here ...)

        that puts a Bike into a Station. Itâ€™s up to you how to do that, while it also depends on the nature of your Station.bikes variable.

        (5) Demonstrate the usage of the addBike(...)  method by calling it in your main() method (put 3 bikes in Station1, and put 4 bikes in Station2).*/
